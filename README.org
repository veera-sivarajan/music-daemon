#+TITLE: Music Daemon

This is my personal music listening tracker. It has a small daemon that watches for music I listen to using ~inotify~ and logs the data to a local SQLite database. The database can be queried through the web interface by the following GET requests: 
1. ~/~ -> complete listening history
2. ~/top/n~ -> top ~n~ most listened tracks
